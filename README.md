# 🏡 House Price Prediction

This project was completed as part of my **AI/ML Internship at OutriX**.

## 📌 Task Description

**Objective:**  
Develop a regression model to predict house prices based on features such as **size**, **location**, and **number of rooms**.

The goal is to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques that can estimate house prices based on various features after proper data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## 🎯 Goals

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Perform feature engineering and exploratory data analysis
- Train regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Interpret results and compare models

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing or inconsistent values
   - Removed duplicates or irrelevant data

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized data distributions and relationships
   - Analyzed feature correlations

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Standardized/normalized numerical features as needed

4. **Model Training**
   - Trained and tested:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest Regressor
   - Evaluated using:
     - R² Score
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)

5. **Results**
   - Compared model performances
   - Visualized actual vs predicted house prices
   - Extracted insights from feature importances
